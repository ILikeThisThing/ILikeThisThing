## Suggestions for Future Features

- Front end needs a lot of love. (Back end, however, is relatively complete and ready for new features.)
- have recommended works only appear once, listing the tags that matched.
	- current behavior: works are listed once for every matching tag, resulting in multiple listings of the same work.
- improve sorting of recommendations:
	- quick change (v1): sort results in order of the number of tags they have in common with the user's submission. minimal work required from what already exists, but huge improvements in accuracy.
	- deeper change (v2): A more complex algorithim to display results to the user -- you could sort by how many times a given work is returned from the database (as in how many tags it matched) -- currently the number of times a given work (say Harry Potter) has been given a certain tag (say Genre-Fantasy) is kept track of and stored in the database.
- allow searching by tag (action, quirky characters, etc.), not just by work and tags provided.
- allow searching by work without providing any information about that work - just using information already stored for it in the db.
- Add more media types -- we would have liked to include boardgames and, more abstractly, music (how interesting would it be to be recommended certain albums because you liked a particular book!)
- Add user accounts/auth. Favoriting, automated recommendations based on previous search history, etc.
